INTERGALACTIC

Back Story
Navigating the depths of space is not an easy task, and is most certainly not for the faint of heart.  Luckily there is one man, and one ship that are up for the task.  His name is Manson, Gil Manson.  If you choose to embark on the epic journey that is Intergalactic, then you must maneuver Gil’s ship and journey through dangerous asteroid fields, while battling the enemy ships that dare to get in your way.  Each level will prove to be harder and harder as you navigate through the depths of space and time, and uncover what truly lies at the center of the universe…

User’s Guide

Objective
The goal of the game is to successfully destroy all enemy ships on each level, while dodging and shooting all of the flying asteroids that come at you. Utilizing the ships guns to destroy enemy ships, as well as picking up special boosters along the way will help you on your mission. There are 5 distinct levels in the game that the player will have to survive through in order to make it to the end.

LEVEL 1: This level consists of the player shooting and dodging their way through a treacherous asteroid field.  Only when the player reaches a certain amount of points from shooting asteroids will the level be cleared and the player will be able to move onto level 2.

LEVEL 2: This level consists of shooting a number of Alien UFOs that are flying past.  Once the player shoots enough of the alien scum are they able to move onto level 3…

LEVEL 3: This is when the player encounters their first Starlord.  This is an enemy ship that will not hesitate to shoot back at the player, so take caution!

LEVEL 4: This level combines asteroids and UFO’s, and the player must blast their way through in order to advance to the last level.

LEVEL 5: The last level of the game is where the player encounters their one true rival!  This high powered starlord is the most challenging to defeat.

Controls
Arrow Keys: Each arrow direction moves the ship in that direction.  
Space Bar: Fires the ships guns. Hold down the space bar for continuous firing.
TAB key: Infinite Lives

Special Boosters
Throughout each level are certain boosters that can be utilized if you fly the ship over them.  They are as follows:

Double Guns: Fire two bullets on every shot instead of one.
Extra Life: Obtain an extra life.

Scoring
Shooting things with the guns on the ship is how you score in this game.  The more difficult the enemy or asteroid is to shoot, the more points you get. Plain and simple.


In-Game Help Screen
The only help that the player will need is access to how many lives they have, which is constantly displayed on the lower part of the screen.  The current level is also constantly displayed on the top of the screen.  The game has a pause feature, that can be accessed by pressing the escape key.  Pressing any key from the pause menu will resume the game.

Quitting the game
Quitting the game can be done by clicking on the red X button on the top left of the screen.  Quitting the game does not save your current level, so you must be ready to abandon Gil Manson on whatever level you choose to quit on.

Autobiographical Info
Programming this game proved to be a bit challenging for me personally.  I had extremely little experience with Python before this class, so the first half of my work flow was simply learning the language and figuring out how to make everything click.  After this was accomplished, I found it was much easier to tackle this game.  I have had much more experience coding things that never dealt with graphics as well, so this was basically a whole new experience for me that I really enjoyed.  It was a very satisfying feeling to test this code, since that meant that I was able to play my game!
I found that I also focused quite a bit of time on the artwork for my game.  I really enjoyed trying out different space-themed backgrounds to see which one worked, and I ended up with a simple one since it wasn’t too flashy and my sprites seemed to stand out the best on it.  I also spent a while finding appropriate sprite images for my game.  There were a lot of simple ones online, but I found that I was much more satisfied with my end result since I spent an appropriate amount of time searching through the web to find these images.  
The game physics also proved to be a bit challenging at first.  It difficult to think of these images as rectangles or circles, and how and when they would collide.  Once I was able to utilize what we have learned in class with my classes, it became easier as the project went along.  
If I had more time to implement more levels I know that this game would be a huge hit.  I also was a little disappointed that we were not able to work with partners for this game.  I understand that it is easiest to grade projects on an individual basis, but working with someone would have definitely resulted in a more refined game.
